### Risk Summary
The data indicates recurring violations across three MRI devices in terms of both usage hours and pressure. All devices (MRI_001, MRI_002, and MRI_003) have surpassed their designated usage hours, which could lead to increased wear and potential breakdowns if not addressed promptly. Specifically, MRI_001 has been used for 10 hours, MRI_002 for 6 hours, and MRI_003 for 9 hours, all exceeding operational limits. Furthermore, each device has exceeded safe pressure levels, with MRI_001 and MRI_003 reaching pressures up to 1.9 and 2.0, respectively, which could impose significant risks related to device malfunction or safety hazards during operation.

The simultaneous violations in both usage duration and pressure suggest underlying issues such as insufficient maintenance routines, lack of adherence to operational guidelines, or possibly calibration errors leading to inaccurate measurements. Continued negligence could result in heightened risk of device failure, patient safety risks, regulatory non-compliance, and increased repair costs in the near future.

### Maintenance Plan
1. **Immediate Inspection and Calibration**:
   - Conduct a thorough inspection of all three MRI devices (MRI_001, MRI_002, MRI_003) to assess for potential damage or wear due to overuse and excess pressure.
   - Perform calibration checks to ensure accuracy in pressure readings and operational hours tracking.

2. **Usage Monitoring and Regulation**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring protocols to track usage hours with real-time alerts when nearing operational limits.
   - Adjust scheduling practices to prevent over-utilization and allow for adequate downtime between scans.

3. **Pressure Management**:
   - Investigate the root cause of pressure excess, potentially involving system faults or user error.
   - Provide training to technicians and operators on maintaining optimal pressure levels and recognizing early signs of discrepancies.

4. **Scheduled Preventive Maintenance**:
   - Establish a regular preventive maintenance schedule beyond reactive fixes, ensuring all MRI machines receive routine checks and servicing to prevent future violations.
   - Incorporate the latest manufacturer recommended guidelines into the maintenance regimen.

5. **Reporting and Compliance**:
   - Develop a comprehensive reporting system to document all maintenance activities, inspections, and device performance metrics for compliance and audit preparedness.
   - Submit periodic reports to the facility management to ensure transparency and discuss any persistent issues requiring strategic intervention.
